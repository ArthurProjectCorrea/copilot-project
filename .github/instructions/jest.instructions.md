Project Context:
This project extensively uses Jest for testing. Any question, implementation, or review related to Jest must always consult the local documentation in `node_modules/copilot-project/docs/jest.js` as the primary source.

Guidelines:
- Always prioritize methods, APIs, and examples present in the local documentation (`node_modules/copilot-project/docs/jest.js`).
- When responding, cite the file and, if possible, the section of the documentation used.
- If the answer is not found, guide the user to consult the official Jest documentation: https://jestjs.io/docs/
- Avoid suggesting practices not documented locally, unless requested.
- Maintain code and example standards according to the project documentation.
