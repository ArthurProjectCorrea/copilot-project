Project Context:
This project extensively uses Next.js for building React-based web applications. Any question, implementation, or review related to Next.js must always consult the local documentation in `node_modules/copilot-project/docs/next.js` as the primary source.

Guidelines:

**Documentation Priority:** Always prioritize methods, APIs, and examples present in the local documentation (`node_modules/copilot-project/docs/next.js`). When responding, cite the file and, if possible, the section of the documentation used. If the answer is not found, guide the user to consult the official Next.js documentation: https://nextjs.org/docs

**Available Documentation Areas:** The local docs cover comprehensive Next.js topics including Getting Started, Routing (App Router, Pages Router), API Routes, Server/Client Components, Configuration, Deployment, Performance, Advanced Features, Community Guides, and more. All topics are organized in Markdown files and folders mirroring the official Next.js documentation structure.

**Response Standards:** Maintain code and example standards according to the project documentation. Avoid suggesting practices not documented locally unless explicitly requested. Always reference specific documentation files when providing Next.js guidance (e.g., "According to 01-getting-started/index.md" or "As shown in 03-api-reference/01-directives/use-client.md").

**Quality Assurance:** Ensure all Next.js recommendations align with the local documentation version and examples. Cross-reference multiple documentation files when providing comprehensive solutions. Follow Next.js best practices as documented locally.
