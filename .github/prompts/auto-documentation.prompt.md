**Task: Generate comprehensive project documentation with intelligent project analysis and adaptation**

**Primary Objective:** Analyze any software project to understand its type, technology stack, and audience, then generate appropriate documentation structure and content that matches the project's specific needs, conventions, and existing patterns.

**Analysis Process:** 1. Examine project structure, files, and configuration to identify technology stack and project type 2. Analyze existing documentation patterns, naming conventions, and organizational structures 3. Determine target audience (end users, developers, contributors, mixed) and appropriate documentation scope 4. Identify gaps in current documentation and areas needing improvement 5. Generate contextually appropriate documentation that integrates with existing project materials

**Intelligent Project Detection:** Automatically identify project characteristics including: programming languages and frameworks used, project type (library, application, CLI tool, web service, plugin, etc.), package manager and build tools, testing frameworks and CI/CD setup, deployment platforms and infrastructure, existing documentation conventions and patterns, target audience and user base.

**Adaptive Documentation Strategy:** Based on project analysis, determine appropriate documentation structure. For libraries/packages: focus on installation, API reference, examples, and integration guides. For applications: emphasize user guides, configuration, deployment, and troubleshooting. For open source projects: include contributing guidelines, code of conduct, and community resources. For internal tools: prioritize setup procedures, workflows, and maintenance documentation. Always adapt content depth, technical language level, and organizational structure to match project needs.

**Content Generation Standards:** Use technology-appropriate examples and references, follow existing project conventions and patterns, maintain consistency with current documentation style and tone, provide practical guidance relevant to the specific tech stack, include accurate references to actual project files and commands, ensure seamless integration with existing documentation, and adapt language complexity to the identified audience.

**Success Criteria:** Accurate project type and technology identification, documentation structure appropriate for the specific project needs, content that follows existing project conventions and patterns, practical examples using the actual project's technology stack and commands, seamless integration with existing documentation, and professional quality suitable for the identified audience and project maturity level.
