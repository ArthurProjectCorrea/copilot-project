"Utilities for controlling how an individual flex or grid item is positioned along its container's cross axis.";

## Examples

### Auto

Use the `self-auto` utility to align an item based on the value of the container's `align-items` property:

### Start

Use the `self-start` utility to align an item to the start of the container's cross axis, despite the container's `align-items` value:

### Center

Use the `self-center` utility to align an item along the center of the container's cross axis, despite the container's `align-items` value:

### End

Use the `self-end` utility to align an item to the end of the container's cross axis, despite the container's `align-items` value:

### Stretch

Use the `self-stretch` utility to stretch an item to fill the container's cross axis, despite the container's `align-items` value:

### Baseline

Use the `self-baseline` utility to align an item such that its baseline aligns with the baseline of the flex container's cross axis:

### Last baseline

Use the `self-baseline-last` utility to align an item along the container's cross axis such that its baseline aligns with the last baseline in the container:

This is useful for ensuring that text items align with each other, even if they have different heights.
