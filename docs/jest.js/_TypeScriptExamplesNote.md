# TypeScript Examples Note

This documentation includes examples that work with both JavaScript and TypeScript.
When using TypeScript, make sure to:

1. Install type definitions: `npm install --save-dev @types/jest`
2. Configure your `tsconfig.json` to include Jest globals
3. Use proper TypeScript syntax in your test files

For more TypeScript-specific guidance, refer to the Jest TypeScript documentation.
