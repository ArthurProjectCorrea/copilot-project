description: Start a Next.js app programmatically using a custom server.

Next.js includes its own server with `next start` by default. If you have an existing backend, you can still use it with Next.js (this is not a custom server). A custom Next.js server allows you to programmatically start a server for custom patterns. The majority of the time, you will not need this approach. However, it's available if you need to eject.

> **Good to know**:
>
> - Before deciding to use a custom server, keep in mind that it should only be used when the integrated router of Next.js can't meet your app requirements. A custom server will remove important performance optimizations, like **[Automatic Static Optimization](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization).**
> - When using standalone output mode, it does not trace custom server files. This mode outputs a separate minimal `server.js` file, instead. These cannot be used together.

Take a look at the [following example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-server) of a custom server:

```ts filename="server.ts" switcher

const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT || '3000', 10)
const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
const app = next()
const handle = app.getRequestHandler()

app.prepare().then(() => ).listen(port)

  console.log(
    `> Server listening at http://localhost:$ as $`
  )
})
```

```js filename="server.js" switcher

const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT || '3000', 10)
const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
const app = next()
const handle = app.getRequestHandler()

app.prepare().then(() => ).listen(port)

  console.log(
    `> Server listening at http://localhost:$ as $`
  )
})
```

> `server.js` does not run through the Next.js Compiler or bundling process. Make sure the syntax and source code this file requires are compatible with the current Node.js version you are using. [View an example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-server).

To run the custom server, you'll need to update the `scripts` in `package.json` like so:

```json filename="package.json"

}
```

Alternatively, you can set up `nodemon` ([example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-server)). The custom server uses the following import to connect the server with the Next.js application:

```js
const app = next();
```

The above `next` import is a function that receives an object with the following options:

| Option       | Type               | Description                                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `conf`       | `Object`           | The same object you would use in `next.config.js`. Defaults to ``                   |
| `dev`        | `Boolean`          | (_Optional_) Whether or not to launch Next.js in dev mode. Defaults to `false`      |
| `dir`        | `String`           | (_Optional_) Location of the Next.js project. Defaults to `'.'`                     |
| `quiet`      | `Boolean`          | (_Optional_) Hide error messages containing server information. Defaults to `false` |
| `hostname`   | `String`           | (_Optional_) The hostname the server is running behind                              |
| `port`       | `Number`           | (_Optional_) The port the server is running behind                                  |
| `httpServer` | `node:http#Server` | (_Optional_) The HTTP Server that Next.js is running behind                         |
| `turbo`      | `Boolean`          | (_Optional_) Enable Turbopack                                                       |

The returned `app` can then be used to let Next.js handle requests as required.
