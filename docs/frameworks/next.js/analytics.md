Next.js has built-in support for measuring and reporting performance metrics. You can either use the [`useReportWebVitals`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-report-web-vitals) hook to manage reporting yourself, or alternatively, Vercel provides a [managed service](https://vercel.com/analytics?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) to automatically collect and visualize metrics for you.

## Client Instrumentation

For more advanced analytics and monitoring needs, Next.js provides a `instrumentation-client.js|ts` file that runs before your application's frontend code starts executing. This is ideal for setting up global analytics, error tracking, or performance monitoring tools.

To use it, create an `instrumentation-client.js` or `instrumentation-client.ts` file in your application's root directory:

```js filename="instrumentation-client.js"
// Initialize analytics before the app starts
console.log('Analytics initialized')

// Set up global error tracking
window.addEventListener('error', (event) => )
```

## Build Your Own

## Web Vitals

[Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) are a set of useful metrics that aim to capture the user
experience of a web page. The following web vitals are all included:

- [Time to First Byte](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Time_to_first_byte) (TTFB)
- [First Contentful Paint](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/First_contentful_paint) (FCP)
- [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) (LCP)
- [First Input Delay](https://web.dev/fid/) (FID)
- [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS)
- [Interaction to Next Paint](https://web.dev/inp/) (INP)

You can handle all the results of these metrics using the `name` property.

## Sending results to external systems

You can send results to any endpoint to measure and track
real user performance on your site. For example:

```js
useReportWebVitals((metric) =>  else )
  }
})
```

> **Good to know**: If you use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), using the
> `id` value can allow you to construct metric distributions manually (to calculate percentiles,
> etc.)

> ```js
> useReportWebVitals((metric) => )
> })
> ```
