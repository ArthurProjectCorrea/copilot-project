## Examples

### Basic example

Use utilities like `drop-shadow-sm` and `drop-shadow-xl` to add a drop shadow to an element:

This is useful for applying shadows to irregular shapes, like text and SVG elements. For applying shadows to regular elements, you probably want to use [box shadow](/docs/box-shadow) instead.

### Changing the opacity

Use the opacity modifier to adjust the opacity of the drop shadow:

The default drop shadow opacities are quite low (15% or less), so increasing the opacity (to like 50%) will make the drop shadows more pronounced.

### Setting the shadow color

Use utilities like `drop-shadow-indigo-500` and `drop-shadow-cyan-500/50` to change the color of a drop shadow:

By default colored shadows have an opacity of 100% but you can adjust this using the opacity modifier.

### Removing a drop shadow

Use the `drop-shadow-none` utility to remove an existing drop shadow from an element:
