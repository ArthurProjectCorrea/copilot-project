## Examples

### Basic example

Use utilities like `brightness-50` and `brightness-100` to control an element's brightness:

```html
<!-- [!code classes:brightness-50,brightness-100,brightness-125,brightness-200] -->
<img class="brightness-50 ..." src="/img/mountains.jpg" />
<img class="brightness-100 ..." src="/img/mountains.jpg" />
<img class="brightness-125 ..." src="/img/mountains.jpg" />
<img class="brightness-200 ..." src="/img/mountains.jpg" />
```
