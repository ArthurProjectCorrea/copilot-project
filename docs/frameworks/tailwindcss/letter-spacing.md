## Examples

### Basic example

Use utilities like `tracking-tight` and `tracking-wide` to set the letter spacing of an element:

### Using negative values

Using negative values doesn't make a ton of sense with the named letter spacing scale Tailwind includes out of the box, but if you've customized your scale to use numbers it can be useful:

```css
@theme 
```

To use a negative letter spacing value, prefix the class name with a dash to convert it to a negative value:

```html
<!-- [!code classes:-tracking-2] -->
<p class="-tracking-2">The quick brown fox ...</p>
```

### Using a custom value
