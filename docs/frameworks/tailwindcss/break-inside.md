## Examples

### Basic example

Use utilities like `break-inside-column` and `break-inside-avoid-page` to control how a column or page break should behave within an element:

```html
<!-- [!code classes:break-inside-avoid-column] -->
<div class="columns-2">
  <p>Well, let me tell you something, ...</p>
  <p class="break-inside-avoid-column">Sure, go ahead, laugh...</p>
  <p>Maybe we can live without...</p>
  <p>Look. If you think this is...</p>
</div>
```
