## Examples

### Basic example

Use font size utilities like `text-sm/6` and `text-lg/7` to set the font size and line-height of an element at the same time:

Each font size utility also sets a default line height when one isn't provided. You can learn more about these values and how to customize them in the [font-size documentation](/docs/font-size).

### Setting independently

Use `leading-<number>` utilities like `leading-6` and `leading-7` to set the line height of an element independent of the font-size:

### Removing the leading

Use the `leading-none` utility to set the line height of an element equal to its font size:

### Using a custom value
