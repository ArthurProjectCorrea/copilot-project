## Examples

### Basic example

Use utilities like `perspective-normal` and `perspective-distant` to control how close or how far away the z-plane is from the screen:

This is like moving a camera closer to or further away from an object.

### Removing a perspective

Use the `perspective-none` utility to remove a perspective transform from an element:

```html
<!-- [!code classes:perspective-none] -->
<div class="perspective-none ...">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```
